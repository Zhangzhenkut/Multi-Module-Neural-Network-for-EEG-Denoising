# Multi-Module-Neural-Network-for-EEG-Denoising
A novel multi-module neural network (MMNN) was written in Pytorch, aiming to remove ocular artifacts (OAs) and myogenic artifacts (MAs) from noisy single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.
# Introduction
**We encourage the use of this model to EEG denosing or other time-series reconstruction tasks.**
